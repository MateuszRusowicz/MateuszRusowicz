## Hi, I’m Mateusz Rusowicz 👋

Full-Stack JavaScript Developer focused on building **production-ready web applications**, with experience in both frontend architecture and backend integrations. I work at the intersection of **clean code, real business needs, and long-term maintainability**.

### 👨‍💻 What I do
- Full-stack development using **React / Next.js / Qwik**, **Node.js**, and **TypeScript**
- Designing and implementing **REST APIs** and system workflows
- Working with **SQL and NoSQL databases** using **Prisma**, **MySQL**, and **MongoDB**
- Building **authentication and authorization flows**
- Shipping and maintaining applications used in real-world production environments

### 🧠 How I think
I enjoy working on problems that involve entire workflows rather than isolated features — designing how data moves through a system, integrating external services, and automating manual processes.
